Project Exist
=============

### PLEASE NOTE
Due to a lack of resources and technical know-how, we only intend on supporting Intel 64-bit builds of Linux.

### The Pitch
Project Exist is an English visual novel (of the psychological horror genre) being developed by a team that, to an extent, rotates. It will be released for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The gameplay will follow a somewhat-branching plot line using a pool of pre-determined scenarios, and the player's choices. Rather than use x/y branching, nearly all branches in the game are point-based. The choices themselves focus on how the player interacts with the other characters. It features two main storylines.

The main "themes" are the thought process and dreams; it is intended that much of the horror doesn't come from what humans do, but how they think. Along the same lines, rather than focus on nightmares, dreams are set-up to influence reality as opposed to the other way around. In a single sentence, our pitch is a game in which you: "Have your dreams affect reality and deal with a girl who can do that far better than you can."

Project Exist is made using the Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine. <a href = http://renpy.org/>Get it here.</a>

### Playing this version
You will not need to use the in-game updater. Simply clone this (and if need be, unzip it). You will need Ren'Py to play this version, simply select the folder ProjectExist is in as your project folder. It is actually recommended that you do not do this, as versions often temporarily break certain... "workarounds" the programmers use. The current Ren'Py version we prefer is <b>6.99.3.404</b>, but we also actively test the game in whatever the nightly version happens to be. (As such, our preferred Ren'Py version tends to creepy slowly upwards.)

### Playing the other version
In general, the latest build <a href = http://wiki2.projectexist.net/index.php?title=Builds>here</a> will suit a playtester's needs. Even if a build cannot be directly downloaded, often it is possible to update to the most recent version using the in-game updater.

### Getting involved
I'd prefer that people join the team through the <a href = http://blog.projectexist.net/?page_id=127>the online application</a>. However, the adventurous may simply send me an email at nolan@projectexist.net and I will most likely find a way to add you to the team.

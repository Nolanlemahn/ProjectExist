         bring their computers to us. Originally, we told them that we didn't 
         have any computer parts. One Tuesday however, I told Robert to let me 
         take a look at it, and as it turned out, the problem was between the 
         desk and the chair."

         network interface controller, which is, of course, the thing that the 
         silly-looking blue wire goes in. The problem was actually with the 
         settings on the operating system. Somehow, the computer was trying to 
         use Google as a router. I was honestly impressed."

         cows eat. Which only makes sense if you know nothing about 
         farming. Ignoring the fact that some farmers do directly feed their 
         livestock animal by-products. Which is basically bad beef."

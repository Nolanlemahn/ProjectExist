Sublime Renpy v1.1.0
======================

Adds context-awareness.
Previous releases took an "all or nothing" approach
to completions and syntax highlighting.
Sublime Renpy now attempts to add a level of context
awareness to both.
For example, plain python functions will no longer be
suggested in a label block, but they will in a python
block, or in a single line python statement.

This release still has issues with highlighting, particularly
on single line python statements. Auto completions should
be good, but subsequent releases should aim to improve
the highlighting.
